This is simply a script used for when you are having a hard time figuring out where you want to go to eat. Configure it by adding your favorite restaurants to the array, and then when you load it in a browser, it will randomly show one of the entries for you. Then you go eat at which ever spot was shown. Easy :).

Change however you want, doesn't bother me.
